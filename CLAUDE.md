# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project

Pickaboo — a Mac-native AI assistant. A floating avatar (`NSPanel`) tracks the cursor, retreats to the menu bar when the active app goes full-screen, and surfaces Reminders / weather / AI features.

Currently at **Stage 4**: the menu bar surfaces upcoming Reminders via EventKit. The Stage 3 autonomous character (wander / escape / dive / approach) is unchanged. Weather is next, then real pixel-art sprite. See `README.md` for the full roadmap.

## Build

```bash
xcodegen generate                                   # regenerate Pickaboo.xcodeproj from project.yml
open Pickaboo.xcodeproj                             # open in Xcode (preferred for run/debug)
xcodebuild -scheme Pickaboo -configuration Debug build   # CLI build (requires full Xcode)
```

`project.yml` is the source of truth. `Pickaboo.xcodeproj`, `Resources/Info.plist`, and `Resources/Pickaboo.entitlements` are **generated** by `xcodegen` and git-ignored — never edit them directly. To change bundle ID, entitlements, Info.plist keys, deployment target, etc., edit `project.yml` and re-run `xcodegen generate`.

## Architecture

The app is an accessory (`LSUIElement = true`, `NSApp.setActivationPolicy(.accessory)`) — no Dock icon. Two surfaces:

1. **MenuBarExtra** (SwiftUI) — declared in `PickabooApp.swift`. Always present.
2. **FloatingPanel** (`NSPanel` subclass) — created imperatively in `AppDelegate.applicationDidFinishLaunching`. SwiftUI content via `NSHostingView`. Uses `.nonactivatingPanel` style and `canBecomeKey = false` so it **never steals focus**.

Data flow (Stage 3):

```
60 Hz Timer (AppDelegate.tick) ──────────────────────────────────────┐
                                                                      │
windowMonitor.activeWindow.value  ──→ obstacle ─┐                    │
                                                 ↓                    ↓
                              BehaviorController.tick(dt, obstacle)
                                  ├─ shouldEscape? → walking(.escape)
                                  ├─ idle expired? → walking(.wander, randomValidOrigin)
                                  └─ walking → advance(dt), arrive → idle
                                                 ↓
                                  origin / facing / animation
                                  ├──→ panel.setFrame (AppKit, imperative)
                                  └──→ SpriteAnimator.update → SwiftUI re-render

NSEvent leftMouseDown ──→ MouseTrackerService.clicks ──→ BehaviorController.reactToClick
                                                              ↓
                                              face + walking(.approach, nearestValidOrigin)

NSWorkspace.activeWindow change ──→ applyPresence
                                       ├─ fullscreen → mode=.menuBarOnly, panel.hide
                                       └─ otherwise → mode=.floating, panel.show
```

**Single source of truth for position is `BehaviorController.origin`.** Don't mutate `panel.frame` from anywhere else — the tick loop is authoritative. Click and window events only influence behavior state, never the panel directly.

WindowMonitorService refreshes on NSWorkspace notifications (`didActivate*`, `activeSpaceDidChange`) + a 500 ms safety poll. `AXUIElementCopyAttributeValue` is synchronous and 1–10 ms per call, so it MUST stay off the tick path — only WindowMonitorService is allowed to invoke it. The active window's bundle id is compared against `Bundle.main.bundleIdentifier` so Pickaboo's own panel never becomes its own obstacle.

Coordinate systems: AX returns top-left-origin rects relative to the primary screen's top-left. `convertToBottomLeft` flips them to NSScreen/NSWindow convention (bottom-left origin, primary screen). All downstream code assumes NS coordinates. `BehaviorController.origin` is the panel's bottom-left in NS coordinates.

**Replacing the placeholder sprite:** `CharacterSprite.swift` is the only file that needs to change. It reads `animator.state` (facing + animation + frame) and renders. The behavior layer never touches view code, so a pixel-art sprite sheet plugs in by swapping the `Image(systemName:)` call for an asset lookup keyed on `(facing, animation, frame)`.

**Why these choices:**
- SwiftUI `Window` cannot become an `NSPanel`, so the floating avatar is built in AppKit and hosts a SwiftUI view. Don't try to migrate it to a SwiftUI Scene.
- The throttle at ~30 Hz is intentional — `NSEvent.mouseMoved` fires per-pixel; ungated it pegs CPU.
- `AXUIElement` calls (Stage 2+) are synchronous and expensive (1–10 ms). They must NOT be made on the mouse path. Cache window frames in `WindowMonitorService` and only refresh on `NSWorkspace.didActivateApplicationNotification` / `activeSpaceDidChangeNotification` plus a low-frequency poll.

## Conventions

- Korean responses by default; technical terms may stay in English (see workspace `CLAUDE.md`).
- Many small files, ~200–400 lines each (workspace coding-style rule).
- Immutability where practical — services own state, views render it.
- No comments explaining *what* code does; only *why* when non-obvious.
- Stage boundaries are real — do not bundle Stage 2 (window monitor) work into Stage 1 PRs.
